Use UNION ALL instead of UNION

Always use UNION ALL unless you need to eliminate duplicate records. By using UNION ALL, you'll avoid the expensive distinct operation the database applies when using a UNION clause.

SELECT
  id
FROM
  tbl1
WHERE
  user_id = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT
  id
FROM
  tbl2
WHERE
  account_id = 1;

Instead of:
SELECT
  id
FROM
  tbl1
WHERE
  user_id = 1
UNION
SELECT
  id
FROM
  tbl2
WHERE
  account_id = 1;
